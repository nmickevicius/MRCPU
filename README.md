# MRCPU_MRM
Magnetic resonance coherence pathway unraveling (MR-CPU) is a method to separate overlapped spin echo coherences that would otherwise be overlapped and indistinguishable in the reconstructed image. This work was submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine on May 7th, 2020. 

This code demonstrates reconstruction of a non-Cartesian MR-CPU dataset. Make sure sigpy is installed from https://pypi.org/project/sigpy/

The bulk of the reconstruction code is in mrcpu_ncart.py
